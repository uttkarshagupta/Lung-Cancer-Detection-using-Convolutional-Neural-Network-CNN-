# Lung Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve the survival rates of patients. This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect lung cancer from chest X-ray images. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can assist radiologists in identifying cancerous nodules in chest X-rays, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Lung Nodule Analysis (LUNA) dataset. It contains a large number of chest X-ray images annotated with labels indicating the presence or absence of lung nodules. This dataset is publicly available and widely used in the medical imaging community for research purposes.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model Training**: CNN classifier with ensemble algorithms for better accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
- **Deployment**: Jupyter Notebook format for ease of modification and scalability.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`)

## Results
The project includes accuracy and F1 score to measure the model's performance.
Visualization of training and validation loss/accuracy trends.
