# Lung Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve the survival rates of patients. This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect lung cancer from chest X-ray images. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can assist radiologists in identifying cancerous nodules in chest X-rays, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Lung Nodule Analysis (LUNA) dataset. It contains a large number of chest X-ray images annotated with labels indicating the presence or absence of lung nodules. This dataset is publicly available and widely used in the medical imaging community for research purposes.

### Data Description
- **Images**: High-resolution chest X-ray images.
- **Labels**: Binary labels indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of lung nodules.
- **Split**: The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
